2015 by what customers described as over 50 per cent on February 1, 2016.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe MYTO template for reviewing tariff increase or decrease ought to be reviewed twice a year and the result implemented every six months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough indices like inflation, foreign exchange rates, gas prices went up with a lower generation capacity, prompting a further

called Cost Reflective Tariff (CRT), NERC planned a tariff hike of the Service-Based Tariff (SBT) in April but postponed it to July due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt approved the hike for the DisCos starting September 2020 but suspended it after severe outrages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Commission amended it with discounts and reintroduced it on November 1, 2020, which makes it the second tariff hike since 2016.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe new increase in January 2021 is the third of such in the last five years with a hike of about 25% on average varying across the DisCos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNERC in the latest order planned another increase by July 2021, which will formally introduce a higher rate known as the CRT that it had targeted
